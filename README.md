Splits image into equal parts for a carousel post

I'm a big fan of carousel posts on instagram and often post them. The software I use to create the posts spits out large but high quality files. 
Using an online tool wasn't an option because of the size, so here's a tool that'll only split the image and do nothing to it's quality.

P.S image location can have "" around it. A small qol improvement but a neat one.

**Make sure opencv library is installed before you run the code.**
